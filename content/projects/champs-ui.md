## The Challenge
The client needed a professional web presence to publish their research findings. Key requirements were **SEO performance** and **Multilingual support** (English & Indonesian).

## The Solution
I chose **Astro** for this project because it ships zero JavaScript by default, ensuring the site loads instantly even on slow connections.

### Key Deliverables
- Implemented `i18n` routing for seamless language switching.
- Designed a custom CMS connection so they can publish papers easily.
- Achieved a perfect 100 Performance score on Google PageSpeed Insights.
