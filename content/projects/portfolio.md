## The Goal

I wanted a site that didn't feel like a template. It needed to handle both my **structured project data** and my **markdown writing** in a single, unified codebase.

## The Tech Stack

- **SvelteKit:** For the seamless client-side navigation.
- **Tailwind v4:** Using the new alpha engine for CSS-only configuration.
- **Shadcn-Svelte:** For accessible, reusable UI components.

## The Result

A clean, type-safe codebase that I can update in seconds. The dark mode respects system settings, and the content lives in Markdown files for easy portability.
